Cloud Computing

Cloud computing refers to the practice of using a network of remote servers, typically hosted on the internet, to store, manage, and process data instead of using a local server or a personal computer. Cloud computing allows users to access computing resources on demand and pay only for what they use, providing a flexible and cost-effective way to manage data and applications.

There are several types of cloud computing services, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtualized computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking, while PaaS provides a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications.
