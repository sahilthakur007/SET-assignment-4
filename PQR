Data Communication
Data communication refers to the process of transmitting digital data over a communication channel, such as a wired or wireless network. It involves the exchange of information between two or more devices, such as computers, mobile devices, or servers, using a variety of technologies and protocols.

Data communication is essential for the functioning of modern communication systems, including the internet, mobile networks, and other types of communication networks. The process involves three basic components: the sender, the receiver, and the communication channel. The sender encodes the information into a digital signal, which is then transmitted over the communication channel to the receiver. The receiver decodes the signal to extract the original information.
